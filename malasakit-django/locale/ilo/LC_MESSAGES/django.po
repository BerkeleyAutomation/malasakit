"With support from USAID and the Development Impact Lab at UC Berkeley, the "
"CITRIS Data and Democracy Initiative is developing a new social media "
"platform that directly engages citizens and communities from developing "
"regions to collectively assess conditions, needs, and outcomes related to "
"engineering innovations in humanitarian assistance, solar energy, democracy "
"and governance, and global health."

"In contrast to polls and surveys that are extremely valuable for analysts, "
"<a href=\"http://cafesystem.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CAFÉ</a> is user-"
"facing: the CAFÉ platform will provide direct, immediate visual feedback to "
"participants, allowing them to instantly understand where they stand on key "
"issues with respect to other participants, and encourage open-ended "
"qualitative responses that can enhance interaction between users. Like a "
"coffeehouse, we envision CAFÉ as a grassroots, user-friendly, self-"
"organizing environment that allows the wisdom of crowds to identify, "
"highlight, and display patterns, trends, and insights as they emerge. To "
"facilitate interactions, CAFÉ will incorporate techniques from deliberative "
"polling, collaborative filtering, and multidimensional visualization."

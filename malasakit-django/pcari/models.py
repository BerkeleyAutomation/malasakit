"""
Model definitions.

This module defines how information used by Malasakit is structured and how the
Python layer interfaces with a database.

The core of the database consists of concrete models derived from the abstract
:class:`Question` and :class:`Response` models. Generally speaking, there is a
one-to-one correspondence between a type of question and its associated
response.

Attributes:
    LANGUAGES (tuple): Available languages. Each language is represented as a
        tuple of two elements: a code and a translated full name. For instance,
        the language code for "English" would be "en". This attribute is pulled
        from the project ``settings`` lazily.

    The ``History`` abstract model records how one model instance derives from
    another.

    The database should be insert-only such that when updating a field of a
    model instance, a new instance is created, rather than overwriting the
    attribute of an old instance. This model effectively implements a primitive
    form of version control to determine which instances are active and how
    instances have been edited.

    Attributes:
        predecessor: A reference to the instance this instance is based on. If
            this instance is the first of its kind (e.g., a new question), this
            reference should be `None` (which is the default value). This
            allows for a tree structure of revisions, where the ``predecessor``
            points to a "parent node" (analogous to ``git`` without merging).
            A sequence of predecessors should never be cyclical.
        active (bool): A flag indicating whether this instance is considered
            usable or not. Typically, when a new model instance is created from
            an old one when updating a field, the old instance is marked as
            inactive.

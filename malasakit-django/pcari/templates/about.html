      With support from USAID and the Development Impact Lab at UC Berkeley,
      the CITRIS Data and Democracy Initiative is developing a new social
      media platform that directly engages citizens and communities from
      developing regions to collectively assess conditions, needs, and
      outcomes related to engineering innovations in humanitarian
      assistance, solar energy, democracy and governance, and global health.

      In contrast to polls and surveys that are extremely valuable for
      analysts, CAFÉ is user-facing: the CAFÉ platform will provide direct,
      immediate visual feedback to participants, allowing them to instantly
      understand where they stand on key issues with respect to other
      participants, and encourage open-ended qualitative responses that can
      enhance interaction between users. Like a coffeehouse, we envision
      CAFÉ as a grassroots, user-friendly, self-organizing environment that
      allows the wisdom of crowds to identify, highlight, and display
      patterns, trends, and insights as they emerge. To facilitate
      interactions, CAFÉ will incorporate techniques from deliberative
      polling, collaborative filtering, and multidimensional visualization.

      Opinion Space, a precursor to CAFÉ that focused on social innovation,
      has been used since 2010 by the U.S. State Department. Thousands of
      participants from around the world use it to organize, visualize, and
      analyze constructive suggestions on foreign policy:

    "Opinion Space will harness the power of connection technologies to provide
    a unique forum for international dialogue. This is...an opportunity to
    extend our engagement beyond the halls of government directly to the people
    of the world."<br>

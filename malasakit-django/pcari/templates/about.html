        With support from USAID and the Development Impact Lab at UC Berkeley,
        the CITRIS Data and Democracy Initiative is developing a new social media
        platform that directly engages citizens and communities from developing
        regions to collectively assess conditions, needs, and outcomes related to
        engineering innovations in humanitarian assistance, solar energy,
        democracy and governance, and global health.

        In contrast to polls and surveys that are extremely valuable for
        analysts, <a href="http://cafesystem.org/">CAFÉ</a> is user-facing: the
        CAFÉ platform will provide direct, immediate visual feedback to
        participants, allowing them to instantly understand where they stand on
        key issues with respect to other participants, and encourage open-ended
        qualitative responses that can enhance interaction between users. Like a
        coffeehouse, we envision CAFÉ as a grassroots, user-friendly,
        self-organizing environment that allows the wisdom of crowds to identify,
        highlight, and display patterns, trends, and insights as they emerge. To
        facilitate interactions, CAFÉ will incorporate techniques from
        deliberative polling, collaborative filtering, and multidimensional
        visualization.

        Opinion Space, a precursor to CAFÉ that focused on social innovation, has
        been used since 2010 by the U.S. State Department. Thousands of
        participants from around the world use it to organize, visualize, and
        analyze constructive suggestions on foreign policy:

          to extend our engagement beyond the halls of government directly to the
          people of the world."

        Malasakit is a variant of CAFÉ originally intended for assessing
        disaster risk reduction strategies in the Phillipines.
        Malasakit was developed and deployed through a partnership between UC
        Berkeley and National University in the Phillipines through the
        Philippine-California Advanced Research Institutes (PCARI) Project.

        However, Malasakit can be applied to a variety of domains, and has been
        designed with the open-source community in mind.
        The following resources are available to anyone who would like to
        contribute to the project:

        With support from USAID and the Development Impact Lab at UC Berkeley,
        the CITRIS Data and Democracy Initiative is developing a new social media
        platform that directly engages citizens and communities from developing
        regions to collectively assess conditions, needs, and outcomes related to
        engineering innovations in humanitarian assistance, solar energy,
        democracy and governance, and global health.

        In contrast to polls and surveys that are extremely valuable for
        analysts, <a href="http://cafesystem.org/">CAFÉ</a> is user-facing: the
        CAFÉ platform will provide direct, immediate visual feedback to
        participants, allowing them to instantly understand where they stand on
        key issues with respect to other participants, and encourage open-ended
        qualitative responses that can enhance interaction between users. Like a
        coffeehouse, we envision CAFÉ as a grassroots, user-friendly,
        self-organizing environment that allows the wisdom of crowds to identify,
        highlight, and display patterns, trends, and insights as they emerge. To
        facilitate interactions, CAFÉ will incorporate techniques from
        deliberative polling, collaborative filtering, and multidimensional
        visualization.

        Opinion Space, a precursor to CAFÉ that focused on social innovation, has
        been used since 2010 by the U.S. State Department. Thousands of
        participants from around the world use it to organize, visualize, and
        analyze constructive suggestions on foreign policy:

        "Opinion Space will harness the power of connection technologies to provide
        a unique forum for international dialogue. This is &#x2026; an opportunity
        to extend our engagement beyond the halls of government directly to the
        people of the world."
